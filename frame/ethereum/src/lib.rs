// A custom weight calculator tailored for the dispatch call `set_dummy()`. This actually examines
// the arguments and makes a decision based upon them.
//
// The `WeightData<T>` trait has access to the arguments of the dispatch that it wants to assign a
// weight to. Nonetheless, the trait itself can not make any assumptions about what the generic type
// of the arguments (`T`) is. Based on our needs, we could replace `T` with a more concrete type
// while implementing the trait. The `decl_module!` expects whatever implements `WeighData<T>` to
// replace `T` with a tuple of the dispatch arguments. This is exactly how we will craft the
// implementation below.
//
// The rules of `WeightForSetDummy` are as follows:
// - The final weight of each dispatch is calculated as the argument of the call multiplied by the
//   parameter given to the `WeightForSetDummy`'s constructor.
// - assigns a dispatch class `operational` if the argument of the call is more than 1000.

//
// Generally you'll want to split these into three groups:
// - Public calls that are signed by an external account.
// - Root calls that are allowed to be made only by the governance system.
// - Unsigned calls that can be of two kinds:
//   * "Inherent extrinsics" that are opinions generally held by the block

//   * Unsigned Transactions that are of intrinsic recognizable utility to the

// result of `Result<(), &'static str>`).
//
// When you come to `impl` them later in the pallet, you must specify the full type for `origin`:
//
// `fn foo(origin: T::Origin, bar: Bar, baz: Baz) { ... }`
//
// There are three entries in the `frame_system::Origin` enum that correspond
// to the above bullets: `::Signed(AccountId)`, `::Root` and `::None`. You should always match
// against them as the first thing you do in your function. There are three convenience calls

// Similar to other FRAME pallets, your pallet can also define a signed extension and perform some
// checks and [pre/post]processing [before/after] the transaction. A signed extension can be any
// decodable type that implements `SignedExtension`. See the trait definition for the full list of
// bounds. As a convention, you can follow this approach to create an extension for your pallet:
//   - If the extension does not carry any data, then use a tuple struct with just a `marker`
//     (needed for the compiler to accept `T: Trait`) will suffice.
//   - Otherwise, create a tuple struct which contains the external data. Of course, for the entire
//     struct to be decodable, each individual item also needs to be decodable.
//
// Note that a signed extension can also indicate that a particular data must be present in the
// _signing payload_ of a transaction by providing an implementation for the `additional_signed`
// method. This example will not cover this type of extension. See `CheckRuntime` in FRAME System
// for an example.
//
// Using the extension, you can add some hooks to the life cycle of each transaction. Note that by
// default, an extension is applied to all `Call` functions (i.e. all transactions). the `Call` enum
// variant is given to each function of `SignedExtension`. Hence, you can filter based on pallet or
// a particular call if needed.
//
// Some extra information, such as encoded length, some static dispatch info like weight and the
// sender of the transaction (if signed) are also provided.
//
// The full list of hooks that can be added to a signed extension can be found
// [here](https://crates.parity.io/sp_runtime/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html).
//
// The signed extensions are aggregated in the runtime file of a substrate chain. All extensions
// should be aggregated in a tuple and passed to the `CheckedExtrinsic` and `UncheckedExtrinsic`
// types defined in the runtime. Lookup `pub type SignedExtra = (...)` in `node/runtime` and
// `node-template` for an example of this.

/// A simple signed extension that checks for the `set_dummy` call. In that case, it increases the
/// priority and prints some log.
///
/// Additionally, it drops any transaction with an encoded length higher than 200 bytes. No
/// particular reason why, just to demonstrate the power of signed extensions.
