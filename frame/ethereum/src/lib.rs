// A custom weight calculator tailored for the dispatch call `set_dummy()`. This actually examines
// the arguments and makes a decision based upon them.
//
// The `WeightData<T>` trait has access to the arguments of the dispatch that it wants to assign a
// weight to. Nonetheless, the trait itself can not make any assumptions about what the generic type
// of the arguments (`T`) is. Based on our needs, we could replace `T` with a more concrete type
// while implementing the trait. The `decl_module!` expects whatever implements `WeighData<T>` to
// replace `T` with a tuple of the dispatch arguments. This is exactly how we will craft the
// implementation below.
//
// The rules of `WeightForSetDummy` are as follows:
// - The final weight of each dispatch is calculated as the argument of the call multiplied by the
//   parameter given to the `WeightForSetDummy`'s constructor.
// - assigns a dispatch class `operational` if the argument of the call is more than 1000.

//
// Generally you'll want to split these into three groups:
// - Public calls that are signed by an external account.
// - Root calls that are allowed to be made only by the governance system.
// - Unsigned calls that can be of two kinds:
//   * "Inherent extrinsics" that are opinions generally held by the block
//     authors that build child blocks.
//   * Unsigned Transactions that are of intrinsic recognizable utility to the
//     network, and are validated by the runtime.
//
// Information about where this dispatch initiated from is provided as the first argument
// "origin". As such functions must always look like:
//
// `fn foo(origin, bar: Bar, baz: Baz) -> Result;`
//
// The `Result` is required as part of the syntax (and expands to the conventional dispatch
// result of `Result<(), &'static str>`).
//
// When you come to `impl` them later in the pallet, you must specify the full type for `origin`:
//
// `fn foo(origin: T::Origin, bar: Bar, baz: Baz) { ... }`
//
// There are three entries in the `frame_system::Origin` enum that correspond
// to the above bullets: `::Signed(AccountId)`, `::Root` and `::None`. You should always match
// against them as the first thing you do in your function. There are three convenience calls
// in system that do the matching for you and return a convenient result: `ensure_signed`,
// `ensure_root` and `ensure_none`.

		// This just increases the value of `Dummy` by `increase_by`.
		//
		// Since this is a dispatched function there are two extremely important things to
		// remember:
		//
		// - MUST NOT PANIC: Under no circumstances (save, perhaps, storage getting into an
		// irreparably damaged state) must this function panic.
		// - NO SIDE-EFFECTS ON ERROR: This function must either complete totally (and return
		// `Ok(())` or it must have no side-effects on storage and return `Err('Some reason')`.
		//
		// The first is relatively easy to audit for - just ensure all panickers are removed from
		// logic that executes in production (which you do anyway, right?!). To ensure the second
		// is followed, you should do all tests for validity at the top of your function. This
		// is stuff like checking the sender (`origin`) or that state is such that the operation
		// makes sense.
		//
		// Once you've determined that it's all good, then enact the operation and change storage.
		// If you can't be certain that the operation will succeed without substantial computation
		// then you have a classic blockchain attack scenario. The normal way of managing this is
		// to attach a bond to the operation. As the first major alteration of storage, reserve
		// some value from the sender's account (`Balances` Pallet has a `reserve` function for
		// exactly this scenario). This amount should be enough to cover any costs of the
		// substantial execution in case it turns out that you can't proceed with the operation.
		//
		// If it eventually transpires that the operation is fine and, therefore, that the
		// expense of the checks should be borne by the network, then you can refund the reserved
		// deposit. If, however, the operation turns out to be invalid and the computation is
		// wasted, then you can burn it or repatriate elsewhere.
		//
		// Security bonds ensure that attackers can't game it by ensuring that anyone interacting
		// with the system either progresses it or pays for the trouble of faffing around with
		// no progress.
		//
		// If you don't respect these rules, it is likely that your chain will be attackable.

		// information about its dispatch. FRAME System and FRAME Executive pallet then use this
		// information to properly execute the transaction, whilst keeping the total load of the
		// chain in a moderate rate.
		//
		// The _right-hand-side_ value of the `#[weight]` attribute can be any type that implements
		// a set of traits, namely [`WeighData`] and [`ClassifyDispatch`]. The former conveys the
		// weight (a numeric representation of pure execution time and difficulty) of the
		// transaction and the latter demonstrates the [`DispatchClass`] of the call. A higher
		// weight means a larger transaction (less of which can be placed in a single block).

// Similar to other FRAME pallets, your pallet can also define a signed extension and perform some
// checks and [pre/post]processing [before/after] the transaction. A signed extension can be any
// decodable type that implements `SignedExtension`. See the trait definition for the full list of
// bounds. As a convention, you can follow this approach to create an extension for your pallet:
//   - If the extension does not carry any data, then use a tuple struct with just a `marker`
//     (needed for the compiler to accept `T: Trait`) will suffice.
//   - Otherwise, create a tuple struct which contains the external data. Of course, for the entire
//     struct to be decodable, each individual item also needs to be decodable.
//
// Note that a signed extension can also indicate that a particular data must be present in the
// _signing payload_ of a transaction by providing an implementation for the `additional_signed`
// method. This example will not cover this type of extension. See `CheckRuntime` in FRAME System
// for an example.
//
// Using the extension, you can add some hooks to the life cycle of each transaction. Note that by
// default, an extension is applied to all `Call` functions (i.e. all transactions). the `Call` enum
// variant is given to each function of `SignedExtension`. Hence, you can filter based on pallet or
// a particular call if needed.
//
// Some extra information, such as encoded length, some static dispatch info like weight and the
// sender of the transaction (if signed) are also provided.
//
// The full list of hooks that can be added to a signed extension can be found
// [here](https://crates.parity.io/sp_runtime/traits/trait.SignedExtension.html).
//
// The signed extensions are aggregated in the runtime file of a substrate chain. All extensions
// should be aggregated in a tuple and passed to the `CheckedExtrinsic` and `UncheckedExtrinsic`
// types defined in the runtime. Lookup `pub type SignedExtra = (...)` in `node/runtime` and
// `node-template` for an example of this.

/// A simple signed extension that checks for the `set_dummy` call. In that case, it increases the
/// priority and prints some log.

/// Additionally, it drops any transaction with an encoded length higher than 200 bytes. No
/// particular reason why, just to demonstrate the power of signed extensions.
