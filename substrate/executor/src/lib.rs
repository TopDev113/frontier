//! Temporary crate for contracts implementations.
//!
//! This will be replaced with WASM contracts stored on-chain.
//! ** NOTE ***
//! This is entirely deprecated with the idea of a single-module Wasm module for state transition.
//! The dispatch table should be replaced with the specific functions needed:
//! - execute_block(bytes)
//! - init_block(PrevBlock?) -> InProgressBlock
//! - add_transaction(InProgressBlock) -> InProgressBlock
//! I leave it as is for now as it might be removed before this is ever done.
